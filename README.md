Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

Artemis Financial is a financial institution that wanted to strengthen the security of their existing web application. Their main goal was to make sure client data and financial information were well-protected by adding more layers of security to their system.

What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

I think I did well when it came to testing for vulnerabilities in my code through static testing. Secure coding is really important because it helps protect both the company’s data and their users’ personal information. Losing sensitive data or trade secrets can cause major damage to a business’s reputation and trust. Writing secure code helps prevent those issues and builds long-term confidence with clients.

What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?

The most helpful part of the process was using the dependency check tool. It made finding vulnerabilities much easier and faster compared to manually checking each dependency. It saved a lot of time and made the process more efficient overall.

How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?

Most of the vulnerabilities I found came from outdated libraries. Updating those libraries helped fix many of the security issues and made the code more secure. In the future, I’d like to use penetration testing to find deeper or hidden vulnerabilities and figure out the best ways to mitigate them.

How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

While coding, I ran the program often and used debugging to make sure everything worked properly. After refactoring and making changes, I ran another round of vulnerability scans to confirm that no new security issues had been introduced.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?

I tried to ulitize Stack Overflow a lot to see how other developers solved similar problems, especially when dealing with console errors. Learning from discussions really helped me solved the problem faster and understand secure coding better.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?

I’d want to showcase my use of a hash function to send encrypted communications. It’s a good example of applying security concepts in real code and shows that I can build software that protects sensitive information.
